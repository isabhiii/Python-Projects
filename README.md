>This Repository contains all the pythone projects I have worked on while revisioning my Python syllabus.
>I believe putting the concepts of Defining function and Loops into practice is the best way to revise them.
>So, these are some projects I have worked on. I sure did face some difficulties at first, but then it was a piece of cake 🧁.
